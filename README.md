## Concept

Our patience has been severely tested because of the lockdown implications. We faced a lot
of different problems, unexpected events and other things that have threatened our mental
integrity. But we can bring out the best from this situation: Now it’s your chance to tell
everyone how you’re feeling… through creativity!

We present you... **Spit It Out!**
"Spit It Out" is phrase used to incentive to say what you are really thinking (in italian
can be translated as “sputa il rospo”, “sputalo fuori”).

Spit It Out is a common space that presents a diary as collaborative canvas: people will create 
a masterpiece of “words traces”. Step by step, the site will ask some questions to the user (useful 
to determine color and thickness of the trace) in order to generate a “river of words”. The final 
result it’s an artwork in which all the bad and good feelings dance together.

The aim of the project is giving voice to deep feelings, whatever they are. Together will
create an amazing and unpredictable artwork that will be shaped by the interaction of each
user.

The entire experience is designed to work on computer and the microphone, as we'll see, it's
the most important and useful device .


## Design Challenges

Different aspects have been useful in the development of the site's design.

(write here a list of challenges or something like that. probably the main challenges was to create a "diary")

### Inspirations

Here I have to write which sites/behance projects have been useful in order to choose the style.

### Visual identity

Consequences of the inspirations research. (logos, palette, fonts, texture, animations)

### UX

An image could be useful in order to give an overview of the site's workflow.
Another littl UX for the recording and writing section of the diary (more specific functions
of the devices mouse + microphone).


## Code challenges

x. How save users's inputs. (firebase)
x. Recording users's speeches
